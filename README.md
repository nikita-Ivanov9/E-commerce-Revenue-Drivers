# E-commerce-Revenue-Drivers

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #555; padding-bottom: 3px;">Project Goal</h3>
This analysis aims to identify the key product and promotion factors (discounts, advertisements, and product badges) that drive "Average Revenue" and "Customer Rating" for an e-commerce platform.

<h2 style="color:#008000; border-bottom: 3px solid #008000; padding-bottom: 5px;">
    RESULTS & STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
</h2>

1. Result: The 'very high' discount segment generated the highest Average Revenue, proving to be the platform's primary financial growth driver.

   Recommendation: Prioritize using the deepest discounts to maximize financial returns.


2. Result: Paid promotion (Ad Boosts) and all three Product Badges (Quality, Local, Shipping) showed **no measurable positive impact** on Average Revenue or Rating.

   Recommendation: Re-evaluate and **reduce the budget allocated to Ad Boosts** and investigate the technical implementation of all **Product Badges**
